                <p>My name is Ali Noor. I am student pursuing my undergraduate studies at NYU Abu Dhabi. If there are two things I am super crazy about, it is travelling and taking amazing photographs! I am fortunate to have travelled to multiple countries and cities. Amongst many of them, some are the ones which are etched to my memory and heart. Therefore, I will be posting about them over here! Please feel free to give feedback on <em> @an3707@nyu.edu </em></p>

                <p>Pakistan - my home country is blessed with all sorts of terrain. From the second highest peak in the world to largest salt mine, there are tones of places to choose from. Since it was summer time, and the unbearable heat of Punjab was boiling my blood, I decided to make my escape to the north. What place could be better than 'Naran Kaghan'. Covered with greenery and scenic beauty guaranteed at every stop! I was the first tourist allowed to enter the valley after recent removal of glaciers on the roadside!</p>

                    The first day, after the 12 hour non-stop hectic drive, I decided to rest and checkin to my room as it got dark already, and prepare for the next day. When the  morning came, I travelling further up north to visit the famous Lake 'Saif Ul Malook'. Known for the stunning beauty of the lake and crystal blue water, to my surprize, it was half frozen! The snow capped peakes, half frosty lake, and clean air made me feel alive. However, this place is most famous for its legend of fairies and princesses who used to live here once. These stories have been narated and passed down from one generation to another. Although, walking on the snow without proper shoes was a challenge within itself. It was an amazing day!

                    After spending a day surrounded by freezing blanket of snow, it was time to go for camping and enjoy the wildlife. I pitched our tents near the end of the foothill. It was when I was informed by the rangers of the sitting of Leopards, so had to redo the packing and pitching again. We did loose out on time, but did happen to enjoy the barbque and enjoy the sunset.

                    After done watching the sunset, with full belly, I decided to take a quick nap. The mosqitoes didn't do any justice, but the stars in the sky did. I woke up to the most 'jaw dropping' view, I have ever seen!

                    After 20 tries, finally got the milky way right! Due to the light pollution in my city, I grew up without the luxury of getting to observe the stars at night time. An industrial hub, the sky is always polluted with carbon emissions from the factories.  However, over here it fealt as if I have never seen something of such sort!

                    Woke Up early in the morning. Prayed the morning prayer near the water stream. The water was from melting glaciers, freshly flowing from the mountain peaks! The flow of the river made it a bit dangerous, but I manned up and did ablution with the coldest water I have ever felt! So much so that my hands went numb and purple. Luckily I didn't get sick. Prayed under the stars, surrounded by calmness and serentiy.

                    The day went by with my interacting with other tourists that I happen to run into, and hanging around with the locals. Hiking up and down, does make happen to make you hungry, and what could have been better than the fresh water trout! However, the catch was, u had to catch it yourself ! The locals taught me how to fish with bait and bare hands. By now my hands were already used to the cold water, just like my cold heart, and without any mercy, I kidnapped a fish from a school of fish. We went onto grill it, and just like that I was the 'Man vs the Wild'.

                    After having chanelled my internal huntsman, I decided to grab a horse and venture all the way to the top until either I passed out, or the horse kicked me off. I ended up reaching all the way to the top. Met an isolated community, living in a completely different era! A very rare religion and culture at a height where your head could touch the cloud. I was almost there! Perhaps it really was heaven! (P.S You can tell the horsy is extremely mad at me)
